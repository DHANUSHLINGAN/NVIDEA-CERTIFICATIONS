Accelerated computing is replacing CPU-only computing as best practice. The litany of breakthroughs driven by accelerated computing, the ever increasing demand for accelerated applications, programming conventions that ease writing them, and constant improvements in the hardware that supports them, are driving this inevitable transition.

At the center of accelerated computing's success, both in terms of its impressive performance, and its ease of use, is the [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda) compute platform. CUDA provides a coding paradigm that extends languages like C, C++, Python, and Fortran, to be capable of running accelerated, massively parallelized code on the world's most performant parallel processors: NVIDIA GPUs. CUDA accelerates applications drastically with little effort, has an ecosystem of highly optimized libraries for [DNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [BLAS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas), [graph analytics](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvgraph), [FFT](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufft), and more, and also ships with powerful [command line and visual profilers](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems).

CUDA supports many, if not most, of the [world's most performant applications](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/catalog/?product_category_id=58,59,60,293,98,172,223,227,228,265,487,488,114,389,220,258,461&search=) in, [Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/catalog/?product_category_id=10,12,16,17,19,51,53,71,87,121,124,156,157,195,202,203,204,312,339,340,395,407,448,485,517,528,529,541,245,216,104,462,513,250,492,420,429,490,10,12,16,17,19,51,53,71,87,121,124,156,157,195,202,203,204,312,339,340,395,407,448,485,517,528,529,541,245,216,104,462,513,250,492,420,429,490,10,12,16,17,19,51,53,71,87,121,124,156,157,195,202,203,204,312,339,340,395,407,448,485,517,528,529,541,245,216,104,462,513,250,492,420,429,490&search=), [Molecular Dynamics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/catalog/?product_category_id=8,57,92,123,211,213,237,272,274,282,283,307,325,337,344,345,351,362,365,380,396,398,400,435,507,508,519,8,57,92,123,211,213,237,272,274,282,283,307,325,337,344,345,351,362,365,380,396,398,400,435,507,508,519,8,57,92,123,211,213,237,272,274,282,283,307,325,337,344,345,351,362,365,380,396,398,400,435,507,508,519,8,57,92,123,211,213,237,272,274,282,283,307,325,337,344,345,351,362,365,380,396,398,400,435,507,508,519&search=), [Quantum Chemistry](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/catalog/?product_category_id=8,57,92,123,211,213,237,272,274,282,283,307,325,337,344,345,351,362,365,380,396,398,400,435,507,508,519,8,57,92,123,211,213,237,272,274,282,283,307,325,337,344,345,351,362,365,380,396,398,400,435,507,508,519&search=), [Physics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/catalog/?product_category_id=6,24,116,118,119,135,229,231,372,373,392,393,489,493,494,495,496,497,498,67,170,216,281,6,24,116,118,119,135,229,231,372,373,392,393,489,493,494,495,496,497,498,67,170,216,281,6,24,116,118,119,135,229,231,372,373,392,393,489,493,494,495,496,497,498,67,170,216,281,6,24,116,118,119,135,229,231,372,373,392,393,489,493,494,495,496,497,498,67,170,216,281,6,24,116,118,119,135,229,231,372,373,392,393,489,493,494,495,496,497,498,67,170,216,281&search=) and HPC.

Learning CUDA will enable you to accelerate your own applications. Accelerated applications perform much faster than their CPU-only couterparts, and make possible computations that would be otherwise prohibited given the limited performance of CPU-only applications. In this lab you will receive an introduction to programming accelerated applications with CUDA C/C++, enough to be able to begin work accelerating your own CPU-only applications for performance gains, and for moving into novel computational territory.
